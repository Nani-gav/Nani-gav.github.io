<!-- Secret Ninebee:
Two teams, crewmates and impostors. One 9b is shankar
crewmates forms the majority. impostors should try to stay hidden

Setup:
Everyone gets their roles. impostors know who everyone is but crewmates do not
One person becomes the meeting head (at random)

game description:
players take turns implementing a policy chosen semi-randomly from a deck. The deck consists of 11 sabotages (benefit impostors) and 6 tasks (benefit cremates). the impostors win if 6 sabotages are done while the crewmates win if 5 tasks are completed.

Gameplay:
Each turn has three parts, election, policy implementing, and actions

Election:
The meeting head nominates a taskdoer and everyone votes on whether the pair is elected.
If the vote fails the turn restarts with new meeeting head. (if the vote fails 3 times in a row the top action is taken. There is a higher probabilty this is a sabotage)
If vote succeeds, move to the policy implementing stage

Policy implementing:
The meeting head chooses the top three actions. He discards one and hands the rest to the taskdoer. The taskdoer does one and discards the other. What each player does is a secret. The meeting head and taskdoer can lie about what cards they got.

Actions:
If its a task, nothing happens now. Start the next turn. If it is a sabotage, the class leader may get to do a special action, expelling a student. This happens now. The actions are specified by the game

Winning the game:
9a wins if they complete 5 tasks or eject shankar
9b wins if they sabotage 6 times or elect shankar taskdoer AFTER 3 sabotages are done

Strategy notes (*these are only if ur starting out the game, after you play enough you will be able to form ur own strategy):
1. Players gain information about others in the following ways. a) Who the meeeting had nominates, b) How people vote c) Whether a task or sabotage d) The action a leader takes

Crewmates usually have no reason to vote at the beginning of the game so doing it is sus
If a sabotage happens, there are three causes:
Three sabotages were drawn, the meething head discarded a task, or the taskdoer discarded a tsask. You have to reason out the right cause -->
